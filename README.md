## Twitter
Twitter is a social media platform with millions of users where the main form of communication is through posting “tweets”, which are short messages with a character limit of 280. Users can reply to other users tweets, allowing for conversations and discussions about any topic that a user might be interested in. This, in conjunction with other features and the fact that Twitter has such a large user base, means that it is a valuable resource for rallying like-minded people, gaining support for different ideas, engaging in meaningful discussions and a whole host of many other social engagement benefits. This helps explain why Twitter sentiment analysis is incredibly useful for gauging public opinion on any topic, and is potentially more useful than other methods for measuring public opinion (e.g. surveys, interviews etc.), where the participants are more likely to fit a certain demographic (with less diversity) and are more prone to bias.
